# padwatch

padwatch is a continuous apartment listing watcher which pulls data from
Craigslist and Zillow. It's a hack and it currently supports:

* Continuous scraping of Bay Area listings
* Walkscore lookup with geotag based on listing or census.gov lookup
* SQLite3 backend for tracking old listings
* IRC reporting with tinyurl shortening
